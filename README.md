### [Tandem Trivia](https://github.com/joshuabseitz/Trivia-iOS)
<i>iOS, Swift, CoreData, UIKit</i> • This is an iOS trivia game that takes data from a JSON file, parses it into questions, incorrect choices, and a correct choice then presents each question to the user individually, adding points when the user guesses correctly and revealing the correct answer when the user guesses incorrectly. The app uses CoreData to persist highscores.

### [Tasks](https://github.com/joshuabseitz/Tasks-iOS)
<i>iOS, Swift, CoreData, UIKit</i> • This app is one of the first projects I completed to learn about Swift – it is a todo list app that stores tasks, uses CoreData to persist the task, and has CRUD features for each task. The project initially used User Defaults to store data, before I implemented CoreData.

### [ParkChicago Redesign](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MwNR-7a9NKlougladmIQspwkeu9k8FR8i_MilLEPPO0/edit?usp=sharing)
<i>Prototyping, Design, HCI, UI</i> • As a part of my Human Computer Interaction course at Loyola University Chicago, I evaluated a digital product in-use by consumers, audited its design, and built a better experience for its consumer. The final project reduced cognitive overload, refined focal points, and align's the app's design with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
